Forecasting/Time-series:
ACF: Combination correlation coffecient vs lag
[-2(1/sqrt(n)),+2(1/sqrt(n))] - Range
While splitting the data you shouldn't do random split

Even after forecasting with Naive ways we need to check error and see if there is any pattern in error. There should be no pattern
Two popular mesures are RMSE and MAPE
EDA for time-series: 
Intercept will take care of nth factor
sample n-1.
For multiplicative seasonality coefficients take care of log value on right hand side.
In forecasting we don't consider significant of coefficients.


TODO:
Why n-1?
coefficients are significant?
