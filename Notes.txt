NN & SVM - black box techniques
Sometimes we add Noise to increase the model's quality.

Forecasting/Time-series analysis:
Time series - Data associated with time
Time series has 4 components:
Systematic part: Level, trend, seasonal patterns
Non systematic part: Noise
Can be used as additive or multiplicative patterns
Level: An average measure
Trend: Persistant upward or downward path
Seasonal: Regular pattern of up and down fluctuations
Noise: Erractic, unsymetric, residual fluctuations. Due to random variation or unforseen events
Additive seasonality - arthimetic progression
multiplicative - Geometric progression
Lag plot:
We will plot original vs lagged one step and check for correlation.
ACF plot: Takes multiple lag plots and takes it in a single visualization
